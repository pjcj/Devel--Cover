How to set up cpancover

Cpancover requires a bourne shell and docker, as well as a recent perl.  The
code requires 5.16.0 but earlier versions may work.

Each module is built in an individual docker container.  This should allow its
resources to be constrained.  In addition the docker container is killed after a
certain time.

I have only run this in Ubuntu 14.04.  The docker version there, 0.9.1 (as of
31.05.2104) is insufficient.  Version 0.11.1 is fine.  I don't know about the
versions inbetween.

The latest version of docker can be installed on Ubuntu as follows:
(see http://askubuntu.com/questions/472412/how-do-i-upgrade-docker)

# wget -qO- https://get.docker.io/gpg | apt-key add -
# echo deb http://get.docker.io/ubuntu docker main > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list
# aptitude update
# aptitude remove docker.io
# aptitude install lxc-docker

You may need to add yourself to the docker group.

Jobs are run as follows:

$ . ./utils/setup
$ dc cpancover-latest | head -2000 | dc cpancover

The top level html and json is generated with:

$ dc cpancover-generate-html
