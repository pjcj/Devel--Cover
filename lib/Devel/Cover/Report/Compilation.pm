=head1 NAME

Devel::Cover::Report::Compilation - Backend for reporting of coverage
statistics in a format like Perl compilation

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 cover -report compilation

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a textual reporting mechanism for coverage data.
It is designed to be called from the C<cover> program.

It produces one report per line, in a format like Perl's own compilation error
messages.  This makes it easy to, e.g. use Emacs compilation mode to step
through the reports.
