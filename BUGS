- BEGIN and CHECK blocks and code in modules is not reported.

- Doesn't play nicely with all of Perl's testsuite.

- elsif and else coverage is reported on the same line as the if
  statement.  This is because perl doesn't store the line number for the
  elsif and elses.  For the same reason the following warning is
  reported on line 1 rather than line 2:

  perl -we 'if ($a) {}
  elsif ($a + 1) {}'
  Use of uninitialized value in addition (+) at -e line 1.

- Pod coverage only reports data for modules, not top level scripts.
  This is a limitation in Pod::Coverage.

- Pod coverage does not work well with source filters including Switch.
  Line numbers are reported incorrectly.
