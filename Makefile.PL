Attempting to make adjustments, but you may find that some of your modules do
not have coverage data collected.  You may need to alter the +-inc, +-ignore

my $d = <<EOM;
The coverage database can be stored in any of the Storable, JSON or Sereal
formats.  To use the Storable format, the Storable module is required.  This has
been a core module since perl-5.8.0.  To store the database in JSON format
JSON::PP can be used.  This has been a core module since perl-5.14.0.  If you
wish, you may install the JSON module which will be used in preference.  To use
the Sereal format, the Sereal module should be installed.  This is available on
CPAN.

Sereal is used if it is available.  Otherwise JSON is used, if available.
Otherwise Storable will be used.  The Sereal and JSON formats should be portable
between all systems, whereas Storable format may not be.
EOM

check "Storable", $d;
check "JSON",     $d;
check "JSON::PP", $d;
check "Sereal",   $d;

check "Digest::MD5", <<EOM;
Digest::MD5 is required to check whether covered files have changed.  You can
download Digest::MD5 from CPAN.
EOM

check "Test::More", <<EOM;
Test::More is required to run the Devel::Cover tests.  You can download
Test::More from CPAN.
EOM

check "Test::Warn", <<EOM;
Test::Warn is required to run some of the Devel::Cover tests.  You can download
Test::Warn from CPAN.
EOM

check "Template", <<EOM, "2.00";
Template 2.00 is required to run the some HTML backends to cover and for
cpancover.  Unless you have specific requirements this should not be a problem,
but you will not be able to use these reports until you install the Template
Toolkit, available from CPAN.  In the meantime you may continue to use the rest
of Devel::Cover.
EOM

my $m = <<EOM;
One of PPI::HTML 1.07 or Perl::Tidy 20060719 is required to add syntax
highlighting to some HTML backends to cover and for cpancover.  Unless you have
specific requirements this should not be a problem, but you will not be able to
use syntax highlighting in these reports until you install PPI::HTML or
Perl::Tidy, available from the CPAN.  However, the rest of Devel::Cover will be
available as usual.
EOM

check "PPI::HTML",  $m, "1.07";
check "Perl::Tidy", $m, "20060719";

print "checking for Pod::Coverage      version 0.06     .... ";
my $e = <<EOM;
Pod::Coverage 0.06 is required to do pod coverage.  This will tell you how well
you have documented your modules.  Pod coverage will be unavailable until you
install this module, available from CPAN.  In the meantime, you may continue to
use the rest of Devel::Cover.
EOM

eval "use Pod::Coverage";
if (my $m = $INC{"Pod/Coverage.pm"}) {
    my $v = eval { no warnings; $Pod::Coverage::VERSION };
    print $v < 0.06 ? "$v\n\n\n$e\n\n" : "$v     $m\n";
    print "checking for Pod::Coverage::CountParents         .... ";
    $e = <<EOM;
Pod::Coverage::CountParents.pm is used for Pod coverage if it is available.  We
will fall back to using Pod::Coverage.pm.  If you want to use
Pod::Coverage::CountParents.pm, just install it from CPAN.
EOM
    eval "use Pod::Coverage::CountParents";
    if (my $m = $INC{"Pod/Coverage/CountParents.pm"}) {
        my $v = eval { no warnings; $Pod::Coverage::CountParents::VERSION };
        $v ||= "    ";
        print "$v     $m\n";

        print "not found\n\n\n$e\n\n";
    }
} else {
    print "not found\n\n$e\n";
}

check "Test::Differences", <<EOM;
Test::Differences is used to display output from failed tests.  Hopefully there
won't be any failed tests, but if there are you will get output that may not be
a model of clarity.  If you do get test failures and you fancy helping me by
debugging them, then you might like to consider installing Test::Differences.
You can download Test::Differences from CPAN.
EOM

check "Browser::Open", <<EOM;
Browser::Open is used to launch a web browser when the -launch flag is specified
with HTML report formats. You can download Browser::Open from CPAN.
EOM

check "CGI", <<EOM;
CGI is used to run the HTML reports.  It used to be a part of the perl core, but
as of perl 5.20 it will need to be downloaded from CPAN.  If you would like to
use the HTML report, please install CGI.  Otherwise, other reports will be
available as usual.  Because HTML reports are expected, GCI has been added to
the prerequisites.
EOM

my $latest_tested = "5.020000";
print <<EOM if $] > $latest_tested;

Devel::Cover $Version has not been tested with perl $].
Testing will take place against expected output from perl $latest_tested.
You may well find failing tests.

EOM

if ($] < 5.008) {
    print <<EOM;

Devel::Cover $Version is not fully functional on perl $].  It should mostly
work, but there are some constructs for which coverage will not be collected,
and you may well encounter bugs which have been fixed in subsequent versions of
perl.  Perl versions 5.8.8 and above should work better.

EOM

    print <<EOM if $^O eq "MSWin32";
And things are even worse under Windows.  You may well find random bugs of
various severities.

EOM
} elsif ($] < 5.008002) {
    print <<EOM;

Devel::Cover $Version mostly works on perl $], but you may encounter strange
behaviours (bugs) which have been fixed in subsequent versions of perl.  This is
particularly true if you are running a threaded perl.  Perl versions 5.8.2 and
above should work better.

I like to have some idea of the distribution of this software.  To that end I
would be very grateful for mail from you.  This will be used only to satisfy my
curiosity and to help me make decisions which may involve changes to the
module.

If you can run perlbug you can send me a success report with "make ok".
Failure reports with "make nok" are also appreciated.

If you have any questions or comments, mailing list details are available in the
README file, or send mail to me directly.
