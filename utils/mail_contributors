Hello,

I'm contacting you because you are one of the Authors of Devel::Cover.

Thank you!

Over 70 people have contributed to Devel::Cover over the years, and I have
finally done something I should have done years ago.  I have created an
Authors file, and you are in it.

But before I publish the file I want to make sure that you are happy to be a
part of it.  Your entry will read:

$line

If you are happy for this entry to be a part of the Devel::Cover Authors file
then you don't need to do anything.  (But feel free to explicitly confirm.)
If you don't want to be mentioned, or you would like the entry to be changed
at all, please let me know.

I plan to make a new release with this Authors file included in a couple of
weeks or so, so please let me know by then.

And thank you once more for your contribution.  Without you, Devel::Cover
wouldn't be what it is today.

With regards,

Paul
